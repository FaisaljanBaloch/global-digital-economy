    "text": "The United States leads the list with $680.5 billion in exports, representing 15.7% of total exports among the top countries. The United Kingdom follows with $449.2 billion (10.3%), and Ireland stands at $340.1 billion (7.8%). India, Germany, and China also contribute significantly, ranging from 5% to 6.6% each. Notably, while these top 10 countries collectively hold a major share, the “Others” category accounts for the largest portion at $1,409 billion or 32.4%, indicating that a substantial portion of global exports comes from countries outside the top 10. This highlights both the dominance of key economies and the diverse participation of smaller nations in global trade."
